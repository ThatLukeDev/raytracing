This is a raytracer based off the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) github book, but implementing multi-threading, following mainly the first part until 6.3, which I tried to do (mostly) myself.
To set up the repository, clone it using `git clone https://github.com/ThatLukeDev/raytracing.git`.
To edit the image produced, edit the `config.cc` file located in the base github directory.
Finally, to render, run the `run` script using `./run`.
